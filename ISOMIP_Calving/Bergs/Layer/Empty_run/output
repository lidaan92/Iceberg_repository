 
***NOTICE TO DDT USERS*** 
With version 4.0 (and later) of DDT, the procedure for memory debugging has 
changed.  You no longer need to compile with the ddtmem-cc, ddtmem-CC, 
and ddtmem-ftn scripts.  Rather, just load the ddt-memdebug module (in 
addition to this module) and compile as you normally would (with cc, 
CC and/or ftn).  The appropriate memory debugging libraries will be 
linked automatically.
